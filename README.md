# Floating-Point Playground

A more intuitive way to experiment with how floating-point numbers represent.

_Currently supports single-precision (32-bit) only._

# Usage

You can directly type a decimal number into the <span style="text-decoration:underline">textbox</span>, the array of bits in the middle shows the underlying binary representation of the given floating-point number.

_These bits can also be manipulated manually, just a click away!_
